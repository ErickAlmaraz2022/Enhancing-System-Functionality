Title: Enhancing System Functionality

Project Overview:
This project focuses on strengthening system functionality and security posture through practical administrative tasks on a Kali Linux environment.
It involves creating targeted archive backups using tar, automating log preservation through cron, and writing bash scripts to monitor system resource usage.
These tools support log management, operational efficiency, and compliance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA),
which mandates data protection for financial institutions.

Objectives:
* Create tar archives while excluding specific directories
* Generate incremental and compressed backups using snapshot files
* Automate file archiving tasks with cron jobs
* Write bash scripts to report memory, disk, and open file statistics
* Organize system monitoring outputs into structured backup directories
* (Optional) Configure auditd to monitor sensitive system files and detect account changes

Files Included:

* commands.sh: Full list of all commands used in the project
* README.md: Project summary (this file)
* system.sh: Bash script that gathers system resource usage
* Enhancing_System_Functionality.pdf: Project screenshots and documentation (if applicable)
